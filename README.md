### pytorch-benchmark

Some scripts for validating models on common benchmarks. Assumes at least Python3 and PyTorch 4.0.


### Supported datasets:

* **ImageNet** (this is essentially just a cut-down version of the [official example](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/imagenet))
* **Fer2013** - A dataset of greyscale faces labelled with emotions.
